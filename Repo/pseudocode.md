### What we need to accomplish
    * allow user to input a zip code and press a button to load
    * run an on click request that executes an Axios GET request to retrieve data from WeatherAPI
        * City Name
        * Current weather
        * Currnent temp in Kelvin, celcius, and farhrenheit
        * a unique image decided by the current temp
    * if request is unsuccessful, return an error message
    * allow user to continue inputting new zipcodes
